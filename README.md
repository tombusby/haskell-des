haskell-des
===========

A Haskell implementation of the DES encryption standard

This is just a nice simple little implementation of DES to help me get familiar with the standard.

The project is currently configured with a .ghci file so that Main.hs can be directly loaded in GHCi, I haven't included similar configuration for Hugs

*Still in very early/heavy development and nowhere near production*

TODO:

+ I need to set up a cabal file so that the base64-bytestring-1.0.0.1 dependency can be automatically resolved
